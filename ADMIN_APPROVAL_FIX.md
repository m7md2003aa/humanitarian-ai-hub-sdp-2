# Admin Approval/Rejection Flow - Complete Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Approved Items Not Appearing in Feeds**
**Problem**: When admin approved a donation, it only updated the status to `'verified'` but never created a listing. Guest and beneficiary feeds only show items from the `listings` array, so approved items were invisible.

**Solution**: When approving (or reclassifying), the admin flow now:
1. Updates donation status to `'verified'`
2. **Creates a new listing** with all the donation details (title, category, clothType, size, color, images, credits)
3. Listing is immediately available in both Guest Explore and Beneficiary Browse feeds

### 2. **Rejected Items Handling**
**Problem**: Rejection was setting status back to `'uploaded'` without clearly marking it as rejected.

**Solution**: Now when rejecting:
1. Status remains `'uploaded'` (allows re-submission if donor fixes issues)
2. Admin notes are prefixed with `"REJECTED: "` + reason
3. Rejection reason is saved and sent in notification to donor
4. Item does NOT create a listing, so it stays hidden from public feeds

## Code Changes

### File: `src/screens/admin/ItemVerification.tsx`

#### Approve Action (lines 79-106):
```typescript
if (actionType === 'approve') {
  // Update donation status to verified
  updateDonationStatus(selectedDonation, 'verified', 'Approved by admin');

  // Create a listing so it appears in guest/beneficiary feeds
  const { addListing } = useDonationStore.getState();
  addListing({
    donorId: donation.donorId,
    title: donation.title,
    description: donation.description,
    category: donation.category,
    clothType: donation.clothType,
    size: donation.size,
    color: donation.color,
    images: donation.images,
    credits: donation.value || 10,
    isAvailable: true,
  });

  console.log('‚úÖ Donation approved and listing created:', donation.title);
  // ... notification
}
```

#### Reject Action (lines 107-119):
```typescript
else if (actionType === 'reject') {
  // Mark as rejected with reason in adminNotes
  updateDonationStatus(
    selectedDonation,
    'uploaded',
    `REJECTED: ${rejectionReason || 'Does not meet guidelines'}`
  );

  console.log('‚ùå Donation rejected:', donation.title, 'Reason:', rejectionReason);
  // ... notification with rejection reason
}
```

#### Reclassify Action (lines 120-156):
```typescript
else if (actionType === 'reclassify') {
  // Update the donation category first
  const { donations } = useDonationStore.getState();
  const updatedDonations = donations.map(d =>
    d.id === selectedDonation ? { ...d, category: newCategory } : d
  );
  useDonationStore.setState({ donations: updatedDonations });

  // Then update status to verified and create listing
  updateDonationStatus(selectedDonation, 'verified', `Reclassified to ${newCategory} and approved`);

  // Create listing with new category
  const { addListing } = useDonationStore.getState();
  const updatedDonation = updatedDonations.find(d => d.id === selectedDonation);
  if (updatedDonation) {
    addListing({
      // ... all fields with NEW category
      category: newCategory,
      // ...
    });
  }
}
```

## Visibility Rules

### Items Visible in Guest Explore:

- Created by: Admin approve/reclassify actions
- **NOT**: Direct donations (those are in `donations` array)

### Items Visible in Beneficiary Browse:
- Same as Guest Explore
- Items from `listings` array where `isAvailable === true`
- Can be filtered by category and cloth type

### Items Visible in Admin Verification:
- All donations with `status === 'uploaded'` (includes pending and rejected)
- Toggle to show all donations regardless of status
