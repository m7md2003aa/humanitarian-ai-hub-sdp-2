## Database Schema Updates Needed

To fully support suspend/activate, run this SQL in Supabase:

```sql
-- Add account status fields to users table
ALTER TABLE public.users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS account_status text DEFAULT 'active',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS suspended_at timestamptz;

-- Add check constraint
ALTER TABLE public.users 
ADD CONSTRAINT account_status_check 
CHECK (account_status IN ('active', 'suspended'));
```

**Note**: The app will work without this, but suspend/activate won't persist to database.

- Database flag is set
- But app doesn't check `account_status` on login
- **Fix needed**: Add check in authStore.login()

### 2. Top Donors/Beneficiaries Limited to 3
- Only shows top 3 of each
- Could be expanded to show more

### 3. Weekly Chart Fixed to 7 Days
- Timeframe selector exists but doesn't change data
- Could implement monthly view

### 4. No Date Range Picker
- Analytics always shows "all time" data
- Could add custom date range
