# CREATE SUPABASE STORAGE BUCKET - Step by Step

## ‚ö†Ô∏è You're Getting "Bucket not found" Error

This means the `donation-images` storage bucket doesn't exist yet in your Supabase project.

## üì∏ Follow These Steps EXACTLY:

### STEP 1: Go to Supabase Storage

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://supabase.com**
3. Click **Sign in**
4. Log in with your account
5. You'll see your projects list
6. Click on your project (the one with URL: `vfzuavexhkheduttyylc.supabase.co`)

### STEP 2: Open Storage Section

1. Look at the LEFT sidebar
2. Find and click on **"Storage"** (icon looks like a folder/box)
3. You should see a page titled "Storage"
4. If you see existing buckets, that's fine
5. If you see "No buckets yet", that's also fine

### STEP 3: Create New Bucket

1. Look for a green button that says **"New bucket"** or **"Create a new bucket"**
2. Click that button
3. A form/modal will appear

### STEP 4: Fill in Bucket Settings

**IMPORTANT: Fill these in EXACTLY as shown:**

```
Name: donation-images
```
(Type exactly: donation-images with a dash, no spaces, all lowercase)

**Public bucket:** Click the toggle to turn it **ON** ‚úÖ
- The toggle should be GREEN or BLUE when ON
- If it's gray, click it to turn it on

**Allowed MIME types:**
- Leave EMPTY or put: `image/*`

### STEP 5: Create the Bucket

1. Click the **"Create bucket"** button (usually green)
2. Wait 2-3 seconds
3. The modal should close
4. You should now see `donation-images` in your buckets list

### STEP 6: Verify It's Public

2. You should see a **globe icon** üåê or text saying "Public"
3. If you see a **lock icon** üîí, click on the bucket name
4. Look for "Public bucket" toggle and make sure it's **ON**

### STEP 7: Set Bucket Policy (IMPORTANT!)

1. Click on the `donation-images` bucket name
2. Look for tabs at the top: **Items**, **Configuration**, **Policies**
3. Click **"Policies"** tab
4. You'll see "No policies" or existing policies
5. Click **"New Policy"** button
6. Click **"For full customization"** (not the templates)

**Fill in the policy form:**

```
Policy name: Allow public uploads
Allowed operation: Check ALL boxes (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  OR from dropdown select: ALL

Policy definition (in the text box):
true

Target roles:
Select: public
```

7. Click **"Save policy"** or **"Create policy"**

### STEP 8: Test in the App

1. Go back to your Vibecode app
2. Try uploading a donation again
3. Check the LOGS tab

**You should now see:**
```
üì§ Starting image upload to Supabase...
Base64 string length: [number]
ArrayBuffer created, size: [number]
Uploading to path: [path]
‚úÖ Upload successful, path: [path]
Public URL: https://vfzuavexhkheduttyylc.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/donation-images/...
```

**If you still see "Bucket not found":**
- Check bucket name is EXACTLY: `donation-images` (with dash)
- Check it's marked as Public (globe icon)
- Try refreshing the app
- Check your `.env` file has the correct Supabase URL
