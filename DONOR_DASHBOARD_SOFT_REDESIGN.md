## 🎨 New Color Palette

### Soft Professional Colors
We replaced bright, vibrant gradients with soft, muted tones:

```typescript
softPalette = {
  softBlue: ['#60a5fa', '#93c5fd']      // Calming blue for stats
  softTeal: ['#5eead4', '#99f6e4']      // Refreshing teal for stats
  softLilac: ['#c4b5fd', '#ddd6fe']     // Gentle purple for stats
  softEmerald: ['#6ee7b7', '#a7f3d0']   // Success green for stats
  softAmber: ['#fcd34d', '#fde68a']     // Warm gold for accents
  neutralTeal: ['#67e8f9', '#a5f3fc']   // Professional CTA color
}
```

### Color Philosophy
- **Soft Blues**: Trust, calm, professionalism
- **Pastels**: Low visual strain, comfortable viewing
- **Neutral Teal**: Modern, approachable, actionable
- **Muted Accents**: Warm without being overwhelming
