# 📸 Image Upload to Supabase - Complete Guide

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Analytics & System Overview**
✅ **Already Working!** Both screens pull real data from your donation store and Supabase.

**Analytics Screen**:
- Real weekly donation chart
- Actual category distribution
- Real top donors/beneficiaries
- Calculated AI accuracy

**Admin Dashboard**:
- Real total donations count
- Real pending verification count
- Real active users count
- Real credits circulated

### 2. **Image Upload to Supabase Storage**
✅ **Now Implemented!** Donations now upload images to Supabase Storage.

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### For Real Users (UUID):
```
User uploads donation with photo
   ↓
Check if user has UUID (real user)
   ↓
Upload image to Supabase Storage
   ↓
Get public URL from Supabase
   ↓
Save donation with Supabase URL
   ↓
Image accessible from anywhere! ✅
```

### For Mock Users (Test Accounts):
```
User uploads donation with photo
   ↓
Detect mock user (non-UUID)
   ↓
Skip Supabase upload
   ↓
Use local image URI
   ↓
Works for testing! ✅
```

## 🛠️ Setup Required

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket (Supabase Dashboard)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Storage** section
3. Click **"New Bucket"**
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `donation-images`
   - **Public**: ✅ **YES** (checked)
   - **File size limit**: 50 MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`
5. Click **"Create Bucket"**

### Step 2: Set Up Storage Policies (SQL Editor)

1. Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Create a **New Query**
3. Copy and paste the SQL from `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.sql`
4. Click **"Run"**

This will create 4 policies:
- ✅ Public read access (anyone can view images)
- ✅ Authenticated upload (logged-in users can upload)
- ✅ Users can update own images
- ✅ Users can delete own images

### Step 3: Verify Setup

Run this query to check if bucket exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'donation-images';
```

Should return:
```
id: donation-images
name: donation-images
public: true
```

## 📱 Testing the Upload

### Test 1: Upload as Real User
1. **Login with Supabase account** (not test account)
2. Go to **Upload Donation**
3. Take/select photo
4. Fill in details
5. Click **"Submit Donation"**
6. Check console for:
   ```
   ✅ "Uploading image to Supabase..."
   ✅ "Image uploaded to Supabase: https://..."
   ```
7. Go to Supabase Storage → `donation-images` bucket
8. Should see: `{userId}/{timestamp}_donation_*.jpg`

### Test 2: Upload as Mock User
1. **Login with test account** (`test@test.com`)
2. Go to **Upload Donation**
3. Take/select photo
4. Fill in details
5. Click **"Submit Donation"**
6. Check console for:
   ```
   ℹ️ "Using local image (mock user or Supabase not configured)"
   ```
7. Image stays local (expected behavior)

### Test 3: Verify Image Access
1. After uploading (as real user)
2. Copy the Supabase URL from console
3. Paste in browser
4. Image should load! ✅

## 🔍 How to Check Images in Supabase

### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to **Storage** → **donation-images**
2. Browse folders (each folder = user ID)
3. Click any image to preview
4. Copy public URL if needed

### Method 2: SQL Query
```sql
-- List all uploaded images
SELECT 
  name,
  created_at,
  metadata->>'size' as size_bytes
FROM storage.objects 
WHERE bucket_id = 'donation-images'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Method 3: Check Donation Records
```sql
-- See donations with their image URLs
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  images,
  created_at
FROM donations
WHERE images IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🎨 Analytics Data Explanation

### Why Analytics Shows Real Data:

**Analytics.tsx** already does this correctly:

1. **Fetches from Supabase** (lines 35-44):
   ```typescript
   const { data: donations } = await supabase
     .from('donations')
     .select('*');
   ```

2. **Falls back to local** (line 51):
   ```typescript
   const donations = supabaseDonations.length > 0 
     ? supabaseDonations 
     : localDonations;
   ```

3. **Calculates real stats**:
   - Weekly donations from actual dates
   - Category distribution from actual data
   - Top donors from real donation counts
   - AI accuracy from verified donations

### If You See Zero/Empty Data:

This means you need to:
- ✅ Upload more donations
- ✅ Verify donations (admin)
- ✅ Have beneficiaries claim items
- ✅ More transactions = more data!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Images not uploading to Supabase"

**Check**:
1. Is `donation-images` bucket created?
   - Go to Storage in Supabase Dashboard
   - Should see `donation-images` bucket

2. Are policies set up?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM storage.policies 
   WHERE bucket_id = 'donation-images';
   ```
   - Should return 4 policies

3. Is user a real user (UUID)?
   - Check console: Should see "Uploading image to Supabase..."
   - Mock users skip Supabase (expected)

### Issue: "Upload failed"

**Check console for**:
```
⚠️ Supabase upload failed, using local image
```

**Possible causes**:
- Network error
- Bucket not created
- Policies not set
- File too large (>50MB)

**Solution**:
- Image still saves locally (fallback works!)
- Fix Supabase setup
- Try uploading again

### Issue: "Can't see image in admin"

**If using mock users**:
- Images are local URIs (file://)
- Won't work across devices
- Expected behavior for testing

**If using real users**:
- Check image URL in database
- Should start with `https://`
- Copy/paste URL in browser to test
