---

## ‚ùå What's NOT Working

### 1. Supabase Storage Bucket (CRITICAL)
- **Status**: ‚ùå Broken - Blocking multi-device functionality
- **Error**: `StorageApiError: Bucket not found (404)`
- **Impact**:
  - Images stay as local `file://` URIs
  - Images don't show on other devices
  - Admin can't see donation images uploaded by donors
  - Beneficiaries can't see listing images

**Evidence from logs:**
```
‚ùå Supabase upload error: StorageApiError: Bucket not found
‚ö†Ô∏è Supabase upload failed, using local image
```

**Root Cause**: The `donation-images` bucket hasn't been created in Supabase yet.

**What needs to be done**: See `CREATE_SUPABASE_BUCKET.md` for step-by-step instructions.

### 2. Multi-Device Data Sync
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially implemented, not active
- **Why it's not working**:
  - Donations/listings stored locally (AsyncStorage)
  - Supabase database tables not created yet
  - Real-time subscriptions not enabled

**What needs to be done**: Run `supabase-setup-simple.sql` to create database tables.

## üîß Setup Required

### Priority 1: Create Supabase Storage Bucket (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Why this is urgent:**
- Without this, images won't work on multiple devices
- Admin can't review donations from other devices
- App is currently single-device only

**Steps:**
1. Open `CREATE_SUPABASE_BUCKET.md`
2. Follow the SQL method (most reliable)
3. Run the SQL commands in Supabase SQL Editor
4. Verify bucket was created
5. Test by uploading a new donation

**Expected result:** Logs should show:
```
‚úÖ Upload successful, path: donation-images/...
Public URL: https://vfzuavexhkheduttyylc.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/donation-images/...
```

### Priority 2: Create Supabase Database Tables

**Why this is needed:**
- Enables multi-device sync
- Donations show on all devices in real-time
- Listings update across devices automatically

**Steps:**
1. Open `supabase-setup-simple.sql`
2. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Verify tables created: `donations` and `listings`
4. Code already supports Supabase (will activate automatically once tables exist)

---

## üìã Current Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBNEfCwBUBtqZ02F-0UV82zlMIHBXQteug
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://vfzuavexhkheduttyylc.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
```

### Supabase Project
- **Project ID**: vfzuavexhkheduttyylc
- **Storage**: ‚ùå Bucket not created yet
- **Database**: ‚ùå Tables not created yet
- **Auth**: ‚úÖ Configured (anon key working)

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **[USER ACTION REQUIRED]** Create the `donation-images` bucket in Supabase
   - Follow `CREATE_SUPABASE_BUCKET.md`
   - Use SQL method for best results
   - Verify bucket exists after creation

2. **[USER ACTION REQUIRED]** Create database tables
   - Run `supabase-setup-simple.sql`
   - Verify tables with: `SELECT * FROM donations;`

3. **[AUTO]** Once bucket and tables are created:
   - App will automatically start using Supabase
   - Images will upload to storage
   - Data will sync across devices
   - Real-time updates will work

## üé¨ Testing Checklist

### After Bucket Creation:
- [ ] Upload donation with image
- [ ] Check logs for "‚úÖ Upload successful"
- [ ] Verify public URL in logs
- [ ] Open admin page on different device
- [ ] Verify donation image shows on admin device
- [ ] Approve donation
- [ ] Check guest/beneficiary feeds for listing with image

### After Database Setup:
- [ ] Upload donation on Device A
- [ ] See donation appear on Device B (admin) immediately
- [ ] Approve on Device B
- [ ] See listing on Device C (beneficiary) immediately
- [ ] Claim item on Device C
- [ ] Verify unavailable on Device D (guest)

## üí¨ Getting Help

If you're stuck on setup:

1. **Bucket not found error**: See `TROUBLESHOOT_BUCKET.md`
2. **SQL errors**: Check if Storage is enabled in Supabase
3. **Images not showing**: Verify bucket is PUBLIC
4. **Data not syncing**: Check if database tables exist

**Quick diagnostic SQL queries:**
```sql
-- Check if bucket exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'donation-images';

-- Check if tables exist
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name IN ('donations', 'listings');

-- View all donations
SELECT * FROM donations;

-- View all listings
SELECT * FROM listings;
```

**Last Updated**: After Gemini integration, admin approval fix, and multi-device sync implementation
**Blocking Issue**: Supabase storage bucket not created (see `CREATE_SUPABASE_BUCKET.md`)
