## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Bucket not found" error
**Cause**: Storage bucket not created or wrong name
**Fix**:
- Make sure bucket name is exactly: `donation-images`
- Check bucket exists in Storage section
- Make sure it's marked as Public

### Issue 2: Images don't upload
**Cause**: Bucket policies not set
**Fix**:
- Go to bucket ‚Üí Policies tab
- Make sure "Allow public access" policy exists
- Policy should allow ALL operations for public role

### Issue 3: SQL script fails
**Cause**: Old tables exist or syntax error
**Fix**:
- Use `supabase-setup-simple.sql` (not the original)
- The script automatically drops old tables
- Run it again - it's safe to re-run

### Issue 4: Donations don't appear on other devices
**Cause**: Database tables not created
**Fix**:
- Go to Table Editor
- Check if `donations` and `listings` tables exist
- If not, run the SQL script again

### Issue 5: Images show on Device A but not Device B
**Cause**: Images using local file:// URIs
**Fix**:
- Complete Step 1 (storage bucket)
- Re-upload donations (old ones used local paths)
- New uploads will use Supabase public URLs

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the LOGS tab** in Vibecode app for error messages
2. **Check Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí API ‚Üí Logs for backend errors
