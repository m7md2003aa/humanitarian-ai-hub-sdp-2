## 🐛 Bugs Fixed This Session

### 1. Type Error in DonationUpload
**Problem**: Missing `value` property when calling `addDonation()`
```typescript
// ❌ Before
addDonation({
  donorId: user?.id || '',
  title: title.trim(),
  description: description.trim(),
  category: selectedCategory,
  images: [capturedImage],
  status: 'uploaded',
}); // Missing 'value' field
```

**Solution**: Added default value field
```typescript
// ✅ After
addDonation({
  donorId: user?.id || '',
  title: title.trim(),
  description: description.trim(),
  category: selectedCategory,
  images: [capturedImage],
  status: 'uploaded',
  value: 10, // Default credit value, adjusted by admin during verification
});
```

### 2. Unused Import Warning
**Problem**: `LinearGradient` imported but not used in DonationUpload
**Solution**: Removed unused import
